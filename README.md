## Profile
Hi! I am a PhD researcher at the Department of Political Science (IPZ) of the University of Zurich (UZH).

I am convinced that the barriers to development (in a wide sense) are not only technical but mainly political. Thus, under the supervision of Prof. Jonathan Slapin, I study the social origins of political selection in the long term. To do so, I use state-of-the-art tools from natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis.
